*Note: I no longer actively develop Housebot. Last time I touched him, I was in the middle of a rewrite from JavaScript to CoffeeScript, and the rewrite didn't yet include the star feature -- the home automation part. So you can either use the code in `master`, which is freshly rewritten but just a generic bot, or the code from around `37b1e88`, which is a bit old and a bit messy but which can actually do the "control your lights" thing.*

# housebot

Housebot is a Twitch chat bot that controls Z-Wave devices, like outlets or lights, with a voting system. For now he
only controls binary switch devices, not multi-level devices like faders. To use his home automation abilities you will
need a Z-Wave hub-like device hooked up to whatever machine you run him on. I use the Aeon Z-Stick Series 2.

Housebot is written in CoffeeScript, and uses [Node.js][1] and [node-openzwave][2]. He is licensed under the
[MIT license][3].

## Chat usage

Housebot chat commands all start with a bang (`!`). They are:

* `!housebot`: Show commands.
* `!quote`: Display a random quote.
* `!addquote <quote>`: Add a quote to be reviewed.
* `!todo`: Display a todo list.
* `!todo <item>`: Add an item to the todo list.
* `!mitosis`: Make Housebot join your channel.
* `!seppuku`: Make Housebot leave your channel.

Quotes added using `!addquote` need to be reviewed by the channel owner before they can be seen with `!quote`. To
review quotes, channel owners have the following three extra commands:

* `!review`: Show the oldest quote in the submission queue.
* `!approve`: Move the oldest quote in the submission queue to the quotes list.
* `!reject`: Destroy the oldest quote in the submission queue.

## Running locally

You will need Node.js. Your package manager probably has it listed under `node` or `nodejs`. Then,

    git clone https://github.com/glacials/housebot.git
    cd housebot
    npm install
    coffee housebot.coffee

If you get errors about `coffee` not being found, you may need to `npm install -g coffee-script`. If that still doesn't
work, try restarting your terminal session.
